A simple Unity tool for capturing high-quality screenshots directly in the Editor.
Originally built to generate **App Store–ready screenshots** (iPhone and iPad resolutions), but it also works perfectly for **Google Play Store** requirements.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage  

1. Drag the **ScreenshotHelper** prefab into your initial scene (e.g., Splash Screen).  
2. Select the **save path** for screenshots.  
3. Click **Sync Resolutions** – this will add 4 standard resolutions to your Game View dropdown.  
4. Enter **Play Mode**.  
5. Capture screenshots by either:  
   - Pressing the **S** key (if enabled), or  
   - Clicking the **Take Screenshot** button in the UI.  

6. (Optional) Use <a href="https://www.photopea.com/" target="_blank">Photopea</a> or other Image editing app to add additional graphics or text to the screenshots to make them more appealing.
